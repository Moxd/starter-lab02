 * Generic domain model.
 *
 * Intended to model both a single domain entity as well as a table.
 * This is consistent with CodeIgniter's interpretation of the Active Record
 * pattern, even though some of the functions are at the table level
 * while others are at the record level :-/
 *
 * Each such model is bound to a specific database table, using a designated
 * key field as the associative array index internally.
